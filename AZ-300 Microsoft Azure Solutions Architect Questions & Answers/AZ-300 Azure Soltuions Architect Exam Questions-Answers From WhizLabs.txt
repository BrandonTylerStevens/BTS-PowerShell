A virtual machine named whizlabsvm has been deployed as a router in the subnet (SubnetB).
There is a requirement to ensure all inbound traffic to the Virtual Network is routed via this Virtual MachinE.  You have to configure a Route table to ensure that the traffic is directed as per the requirement
Which of the following would you specify as the address prefix for the Route tablE.
A.  10.0.0.0/16
B.  10.0.1.0/24
C.  10.0.0.0/24
D.  10.0.254.0/24
Explanation:  Answer – A
Based on the

Question, we can look at the Infrastructure being panned out as shown below. Normally a gateway subnet would mean that the company has a Site-to-Site VPN connection to their on-premise data center. And the

Questionalso points to the fact that traffic needs to be directed from the Site-to-Site VPN (All incoming traffic) through the Virtual Machine appliance in SubnetB.  Now since we want all traffic for the Virtual Network to be routed to the route VM , that means any request to the Virtual Network IP address prefix – 10.0.0.0/16 should be routed through the VM.
That’s why the address prefix must be marked as 10.0.0.0/16. And that is why all other options would be incorrect.

The services will be hosted on Azure Virtual Machines which will interact with Azure SQL database and Azure Table storage as the backend store. The functionality of some of the services are given below
Course Display Service - This is used to store and display information about courses. Here the data need not be persisted across sessions.
Login Service - This managed the login for the user. Here the data needs to be persisted across sessions.
Student details - This service is used to display the details of students. Here the data needs to be persisted across sessions.
As per the current architecture recommendations, the services will be designed using the Microservices architecture. Azure Service Fabric will be used as the underlying Azure servicE.  You have to ensure you create the right service types in Azure Service Fabric
You decide to use stateful Reliable Service for all services.
Does this fulfil the requirement?
A.  Yes
B.  No
Explanation:  Answer – B
This is NOT the right approach. Since you don’t need to maintain session information for the Course Display Service you can use a stateless Reliable Service for this. And then you can use the stateful Reliable Services for the other services.

A company currently has 2 virtual networks as shown below. Currently there are no virtual machines defined in either subnE.  Subnet in whizlab-vnet1
Subnet in whizlab-vnet2
The company wants to implement Virtual Network Peering. Which of the following needs to be carried our first before implementing Virtual Network peering?  Pick 3 options.
Note - Any one option is enough to get the peering donE.
A.  Add a subnet to whizlab-vnet1
B.  Add a subnet to whizlab-vnet2
C.  Add an address space to whizlab-vnet2
D.  Modify the existing address space of whizlab-vnet1
E.  Modify the existing address space of whizlab-vnet2
Explanation:  Answer – C, D & E
Here address space or CIDR of both VNet is same or overlapping to each other and each VNet has some resource i.e. subnE.  So we can not modify or change CIDR of both IP
So solution is add some more address space in either VNet so that peering can be establisheD.  Option A: Adding more subnet is also not possible as full addresses of Whizlabs-VNet1 has already been utilized by subnet "default"
Option B Adding more subnet is also not possible as full addresses of Whizlabs-VNet2 has already been utilized by subnet "default"
Option C This is possible as we can add new address space into existing VNet and will solve "must have non-overlapping IP address spaces."
Option D: since no resources are available we can change the address space, provided there's no conflict.
Option E: since no resources are available we can change the address spacE.  For more information on virtual network peering, please visit the below URL

A company has an Azure subscription. They have created a couple of Azure machines that use unmanaged, standard hard disk drives (HDD).
A recovery strategy needs to be in place for the Virtual Machines. Below are the key requirements
Recovery time objective of up to 7 days
Failover to another region if the primary region goes down
Solution must minimize costs
Which of the following would you implement for this requirement?
A.  Store disks using Standard_LRS replication. If a disaster occurs, manually create the virtual machines by using Azure Resource manager templates.
B.  Store disks using Standard_LRS replication. Use Site Recovery to initiate a failover if requireD.
C.  Store disks using Standard_GRS replication. If a disaster occurs, manually create the virtual machines by using Azure Resource manager templates.
D.  Store disks using Standard_GRS replication. Use Site Recovery to initiate a failover if requireD.
Explanation:
Answer – C
Here the most cost-effective solution would be just to replicate the disks using the inbuilt replication of Geo redundant storage
The Microsoft documentation mentions the following on Geo redundant storage replication
Option A is incorrect since this would not allow for failover if the primary region goes down
